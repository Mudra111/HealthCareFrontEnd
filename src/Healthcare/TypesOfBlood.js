						<h4>What is it?</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							“Whole blood” is simply the blood that flows through your veins.
							It contains red cells, white cells, and platelets, suspended in
							plasma.
						</p>
						<h4>Who it helps</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							Whole blood is frequently given to trauma patients and people
							undergoing surgery.
						</p>
						<h4>Time it takes</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">About 1 hour</p>
						<h4>Ideal blood types</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">All blood types</p>
						<h4>Donation frequency</h4>

						<h2 className="title">Platelet Donation</h2>
						<h4>What is it?</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							Platelets are tiny cells in your blood that form clots and stop
							bleeding. Platelets are most often used by cancer patients and
							others facing life-threatening illnesses and injuries. In a
							platelet donation, an apheresis machine collects your platelets
							along with some plasma, returning your red cells and most of the
							plasma back to you. A single donation of platelets can yield
							several transfusable units, whereas it takes about five whole
							blood donations to make up a single transfusable unit of
							platelets.
						</p>
						<h4>Who it helps</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							Platelets are a vital element of cancer treatments and organ
							transplant procedures, as well as other surgical procedures.
						</p>
						<h4>Time it takes</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">About 2.5-3 hours</p>
						<h4>Ideal blood types</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							A positive, A negative, B positive, O positive, AB positive and AB
							negative
						</p>
						<h4>Donation frequency</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">Every 7 days, up to 24 times/year</p>

						<h2 className="title">Plasma Donation</h2>
						<h4>What is it?</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							During an AB Elite donation, you give plasma, a part of your blood
							used to treat patients in emergency situations. AB plasma can be
							given to anyone regardless of their blood type. Plasma is
							collected through an automated process that separates plasma from
							other blood components, then safely and comfortably returns your
							red blood cells and platelets to you. AB Elite maximizes your
							donation and takes just a few minutes longer than donating blood.
						</p>
						<h4>Who it helps</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							AB Plasma is used in emergency and trauma situations to help stop
							bleeding.{" "}
						</p>
						<h4>Time it takes</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">About 1 hour and 15 minutes</p>
						<h4>Ideal blood types</h4>

						<h2 className="title">Power Red Donation</h2>
						<h4>What is it?</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							Power Red is similar to a whole blood donation, except a special
							machine is used to allow you to safely donate two units of red
							blood cells during one donation while returning your plasma and
							platelets to you.
						</p>
						<h4>Who it helps</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							Red cells from a Power Red donation are typically given to trauma
							patients, newborns and emergency transfusions during birth, people
							with sickle cell anemia, and anyone suffering blood loss.
						</p>
						<h4>Time it takes</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">About 1.5 hours</p>
						<h4>Ideal blood types</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">
							O positive, O negative, A negative, and B negative
						</p>
						<h4>Donation frequency</h4>
						<p className="tobd-con">Every 112 days, up to 3 times/year</p>
